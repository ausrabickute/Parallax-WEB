# Parallax Website with HTML & CSS
This WEB page is designed for learning purposes.
My purpose was built implementation of a parallax website with fixed scrolling using HTML and CSS. Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.

Check out the [working demo](https://ausrabickute.github.io/Parallax-WEB/)!
